## 7 Days of JavaScript   
### A humble not to the readers / practitioners    
This 7-day journey is a personal challenge to acquire some foundational knowledge on `JavaScript` for writing tests in `Postman` and building `XSS` payloads.  
This approach is subjective to accomplish the author's specific needs and a documentation for acquiring more advanced knowledge in the future by doing more practical codes.  
It is highly DiScoUrAgEd to use this material as a tutorial.  
Fellow n00b (Pen)TesterSQA are welcome to give their feedback and contribution to enrich this documentation.   
Thanks In Advance
